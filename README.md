# FoxNet

FoxNet is an individual-based modelling framework that can be customised to generate high-resolution red fox *Vulpes vulpes* population models for both northern and southern hemispheres.  FoxNet can be used to predict red fox population density, age structure, composition and responses to management across an entire landscape or within customised region(s) of interest. Model landscapes (up to ~15,000 km<sup>2</sup>) and bait layouts can be generated within FoxNet or imported as GIS layers, along with survey transects and barriers to movement.

## Getting Started

You can download the latest release of FoxNet from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2572045.  The release package includes a User Guide.

### Prerequisites

Netlogo can be freely downloaded from https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/. 

## Built With

FoxNet v 1 was written and run with Netlogo v 6.0.2 and R v 3.5.1, using  the RNetLogo package.

FoxNet v 2.0.0 was updated using Netlogo v 6.2.2, R v 4.1.3 and the nlrx package.  Note that this later version of Netlogo is not compatible with RNetLogo.
