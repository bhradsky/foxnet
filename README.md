# FoxNet

FoxNet is an individual-based modelling framework that can be customised to generate high-resolution fox population models for both northern and southern hemispheres.  FoxNet predicts red fox population dynamics, including responses to control and landscape productivity. Model landscapes (up to ~15,000 km<sup>2</sup> and bait layouts can be generated within FoxNet or imported as GIS layers.
